# 🐍 60 Days of Python

## 🚀 About This Repository
Welcome to my **60 Days of Python** learning journey!  
This repository is a commitment to **consistency, discipline, and growth** — one day at a time.

For the next 60 days, I will code **every single day**, learn new Python concepts, practice problems, and build small projects to strengthen my foundations and problem-solving skills.

> **Goal:** Progress over perfection.

## 🎯 Why This Challenge?
- To build a **strong Python foundation**
- To develop the habit of **daily coding**
- To learn by **doing, failing, and improving**
- To document my journey and track progress publicly

Consistency beats motivation. Showing up every day is the real win 💪
