# Pips and modules in python

# Concept     	Meaning

# Module      	A Python file with code
# Package     	A collection of modules
# pip         	Tool to install packages
# import	    Used to use a module

# What is a Module in Python?
# Think of a module like a toolbox
# Instead of writing everything from scratch, Python lets you reuse code that’s already written.

# A module is simply a file that contains Python code:
# functions
# variables
# classes
# You can import that file and use what’s inside it.

# 📦 Why modules exist
# Without modules:
# Your code would be very long
# You’d repeat the same logic again and again

# With modules:
# Code is organized
# Easy to reuse
# Easy to read and maintain

import math

print(math.sqrt(16))   # 4.0
print(math.pi)         # 3.141592653589793

# External / third-party modules
# These are not included with Python.
# Examples:
# numpy
# pandas
# requests
# flask

# 👉 This is where pip comes in.

# What is pip in Python?
# pip = Python Package Installer

# Think of pip as:
# 🛒 An app store for Python libraries

# It lets you:
# Download
# Install
# Update
# Remove Python packages (modules)

# 📦 What is a package?
# A package is a collection of modules
# Often very powerful and large

# Example:
# numpy → math & arrays
# pandas → data analysis
# requests → HTTP requests

# Will understand about pips and modules in detail while working on projects.
